# 🌐 WebRTC Client

This is the client part of our WebRTC SFU project. It is written in Typescript and is responsible for interacting with the signaling server and establishing a WebRTC connection with the SFU.

## ✨ Features

- **WebRTC Connection**: Establishes a WebRTC connection with the SFU through the signaling server.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Communicates with the signaling server using WebSockets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the client directory.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the client with `npm run dev`.
4. The client will now try to establish a connection with the signaling server.

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can configure the client by editing the `.env` file in the client directory. Here you can set the address of the signaling server and other options.
