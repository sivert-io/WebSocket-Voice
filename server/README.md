# 🌐 WebRTC Server

This is the server part of our WebRTC SFU project. It is written in Typescript and is responsible for managing the signaling process and forwarding media streams.

## ✨ Features

- **WebRTC Signaling**: Manages the WebRTC signaling process.
- **Media Stream Forwarding**: Forwards media streams to the connected clients.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the server folder.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm run dev`.
4. The server will now wait for clients to connect and start the signaling process.

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can configure the server by editing the `.env` file in the server directory. Here you can set the WebSocket server options and other settings.
