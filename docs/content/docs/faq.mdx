# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about Gryt voice chat platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is Gryt?

Gryt is a modern WebRTC-based voice chat platform that provides Discord-like voice communication with enterprise-grade audio quality. It features real-time voice activity detection, advanced audio processing, and a beautiful modern interface.

### How do I get started with Gryt?

The easiest way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivert-io/WebSocket-Voice.git && cd webrtc && docker-compose up -d
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### What are the system requirements?

**Client Requirements:**
- Modern browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Microphone and speakers/headphones
- Stable internet connection

**Server Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+ and Bun (for client/server)
- Go 1.21+ (for SFU)
- Docker 20.10+ (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes 1.24+ (for K8s deployment)

### Do I need to set up authentication?

No! Authentication is provided as a centrally hosted service by the Gryt team. Your servers automatically connect to the official Gryt Auth API at `https://auth.gryt.chat`.

## üéôÔ∏è Audio and Voice

### Why isn't my microphone working?

Common causes and solutions:

1. **Browser permissions**: Check that your browser has microphone access
2. **HTTPS required**: WebRTC requires HTTPS in production
3. **Device selection**: Ensure the correct microphone is selected
4. **Browser compatibility**: Try a different browser

### How do I improve audio quality?

1. **Use headphones**: Avoid echo and feedback
2. **Adjust noise gate**: Fine-tune the noise gate threshold
3. **Check microphone levels**: Ensure proper input levels
4. **Use quality equipment**: Better microphones provide better results

### Can I use push-to-talk?

Push-to-talk is coming soon! Currently, Gryt uses voice activation with configurable thresholds.

### How does the noise gate work?

The noise gate filters out background noise below a configurable threshold. It uses:
- **Threshold**: -50dB to -10dB (configurable)
- **Attack Time**: 10ms (fast response to speech)
- **Release Time**: 100ms (smooth fade-out)

## üåê Multi-Server

### How do I add multiple servers?

You can add servers through the client interface:

1. Click the "+" button in the server list
2. Enter the server URL
3. The client will validate and connect to the server

### Can I switch between servers without losing connection?

Yes! Gryt maintains connections to multiple servers simultaneously, allowing seamless switching without losing your voice connection.

### How are rooms isolated between servers?

Each server uses unique room IDs with server prefixes (e.g., `techial_voice`, `gryta_general`) to prevent cross-server interference.

## üîß Configuration

### How do I configure STUN/TURN servers?

For production deployments, configure STUN/TURN servers in your SFU environment:

```bash
# In sfu-v2/.env
STUN_SERVERS=stun:stun.l.google.com:19302,stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302
TURN_SERVERS=turn:your-turn-server.com:3478
TURN_USERNAME=your-username
TURN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Can I customize the server name and icon?

Yes! Configure these in your server environment:

```bash
# In server/.env
SERVER_NAME="My Custom Server"
SERVER_ICON="my-icon.png"
```

### How do I set up SSL/TLS?

For production, you need SSL certificates. Configure them in your reverse proxy or load balancer:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5173;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
